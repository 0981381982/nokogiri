This package uses the Debian 3.0 (quilt) source package format.

The upstream tarball has been repacked to remove ports/archives
containing convenience copies of the following libraries:
libxml2-2.8.0.tar.gz  libxslt-1.1.26.tar.gz

The removal has been done with git-buildpackage, during the import
of the upstream tarball via git import-orig command and its filter
option (see debian/gbp.conf).
